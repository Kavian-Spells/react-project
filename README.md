- By <strong>September 28th</strong>, the project must be publicly deployed and accessible. However it is a good idea to release early and release often.
- Your MVP should be done by <strong>September 18th</strong>. Use the rest of the time to do stretch goals and fix bugs.
- Code for at least one hour EVERYDAY
- Every repo should have a README file explaining the project and how to install it and run it.
- Perform Pull Requests and Code Reviews with others.
- Every team will have 5 minutes to present thier project. Be sure to present:
    1. What your project does?
    2. The technology you used?
    3. Problems you encountered and how you solved them.
    4. Anything else cool?
